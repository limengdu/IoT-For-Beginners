# SenseCAP K1100 - Train a fruit model

## Overview

In this part of the lesson, we will teach you how to train your own AI model for your specific application and then deploy it easily to the Grove - Vision AI Module. Let's get started!

## Software introduction

We will be using the following software technologies in this lesson.

- Roboflow - for annotating 
- YOLOv5 - for training 
- TensorFlow Lite - for inferencing

<div align=center><img width=600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/57.png"/></div>

### What is Roboflow?

[Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) is an annotation tool based online. This tool allows you to easily annotate all your images, add further processing to these images and export the labeled dataset into different formats such as YOLOV5 PyTorch, Pascal VOC, and more! Roboflow also has public datasets readily available to users.

### What is YOLOv5?

YOLO is an abbreviation for the term ‚ÄòYou Only Look Once‚Äô. It is an algorithm that detects and recognizes various objects in an image in real-time. Ultralytics [YOLOv5](https://ultralytics.com/yolov5) is the version of YOLO based on the PyTorch framework.

### What is TensorFlow Lite?

[TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) is an open-source, product ready, cross-platform deep learning framework that converts a pre-trained model in TensorFlow to a special format that can be optimized for speed or storage. The special format model can be deployed on edge devices like mobiles using Android or iOS or Linux based embedded devices like Raspberry Pi or Microcontrollers to make the inference at the Edge.

## Lesson structure

This lesson will be divided into three main sections.

1. [Train your own AI model with a public dataset](#jump1)
2. [Train your own AI model with your own dataset](#jump2)
3. [Deploy the trained AI model into Grove - Vision AI Module](#jump3)

The first section will be the fastest way to build your own AI model with the least number of steps. The second section will take some time and effort to build your own AI model, but it will be definitely worth the knowledge. The third section about deploying the AI model can be done either after first or second section.

So there are two ways to follow this lesson:

1. Follow [section 1](#jump1) and then [section 3](#jump3) - fast to follow
2. Follow [section 2](#jump2) and then [section 3](#jump3) - slow to follow

However, we encourage to follow the first way at first and then move onto the second way.

## <span id="jump1">Train your own AI model with a public dataset</span>

The very first step of an object detection project is to obtain data for training. You can either download datasets available publicly or create your own dataset! 

But what is the fastest and easiest way to get started with object detection? Well...Using public datasets can save you a lot of time that you would otherwise spend on collecting data by yourself and annotating them. These public datasets are already annotated out-of-the-box, giving you more time to focus on your AI vision applications.

### Hardware preparation

- Grove - Vision AI Module
- USB Type-C cable 
- Windows/ Linux/ Mac with internet access

### Software preparation

- No need to prepare additional software

### Task - Use publicly available annotated dataset

You can download a number of publically available datasets such as the  [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org), [Pascal VOC dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC) and much more. [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com) is a recommended platform which provides a wide-range of datasets and it has [90,000+ datasets with 66+ million images](https://blog.roboflow.com/computer-vision-datasets-and-apis) available for building computer vision models. Also, you can simply search **open-source datasets** on Google and choose from a variety of datasets available.

1. Visit [this URL](https://universe.roboflow.com/lakshantha-dissanayake/apple-detection-5z37o/dataset/1) to access an Apple Detection dataset available publicly on Roboflow Universe.

2. Click **Create Account** to create a Roboflow account.

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/53.png"/></div>

3. Click **Download**, select **YOLO v5 PyTorch** as the **Format**, click **show download code** and click **Continue**.

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/51.png"/></div>

    This will generate a code snippet that we will use later inside Google Colab training. So please keep this window open in the background.

    <div align=center><img width=700 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/52.png"/></div>

### Task Train using YOLOv5 on Google Colab

After we have chosen a public dataset, we need to train the dataset. Here we use a Google Colaboratory environment to perform training on the cloud. Furthermore, we use Roboflow api within Colab to easily download our dataset.

Click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/lakshanthad/b47a1d1a9b4fac43449948524de7d374/yolov5-training-for-sensecap-a1101.ipynb) to open an already prepared Google Colab workspace, go through the steps mentioned in the workspace and run the code cells one by one.

> üíÅ On Google Colab, in the code cell under **Step 4**, you can directly copy the code snippet from Roboflow as mentioned above.

It will walkthrough the following:

- Setup an environment for training
- Download a dataset
- Perform the training
- Download the trained model

<div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/18.png"/></div>

For an apple detection dataset with 699 images, it took around 7 minutes to finish the training process on Google Colab running on NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU with 16GB GPU memory.

<div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/43.png"/></div>

If you followed the above Colab project, you know that you can load 4 models to the device all at once. However, please note that only one model can be loaded at a time. This can be specified by the user and will be explained later in this lesson.

### Task - Deploy and inference

If you directly want to jump to **section 3** which explains how to deploy the trained AI model into Grove - Vision AI Module and perform inference, [click here](#jump3).

## <span id="jump2">Train your own AI model with your own dataset</span>

If you want to build specific object detection projects where the public datasets do not have the objects that you want to detect, you might want to build your own dataset.  When you record data for your own dataset, you have to make sure that you cover all angles (360 degrees) of the object, place the object in different environments, different lighting and different weather conditions. After recording your own dataset, you also have to annotate the images in the datset. All these steps will be convered in this section.

Eventhough there are different methods of collecting data such as using a mobile phone camera, the best way to collect data is to use the in-built camera on the Grove - Vision AI Module. This is because the colors, image quality and other details will be similar when we perform inference on Grove - Vision AI Module which makes the overall detection more accurate.

### Hardware preparation

- Grove - Vision AI Module
- USB Type-C cable 
- Windows/ Linux/ Mac with internet access

### Software preparation

Now let's setup the software. The software setup for Windows, Linux and Intel Mac will be same whereas for M1/M2 Mac will be different.

#### Windows, Linux, Intel Mac

1. Make sure Python is already installed on the computer. If not, visit [this page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download and install latest version of Python.

2. Install the following dependency.

    ```sh
    pip3 install libusb1
    ```

#### M1/ M2 Mac

1. Install Homebrew.

    ```sh
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

2. Install conda.

    ```sh
    brew install conda
    ```

3. Download libusb.

    ```sh
    wget https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/osx-arm64/libusb-1.0.26-h1c322ee_100.tar.bz2
    ```

4. Install libusb.

    ```sh
    conda install libusb-1.0.26-h1c322ee_100.tar.bz2
    ```

### Task - Collect dataset

1. Connect Grove - Vision AI Module to PC by using USB Type-C cable.

    <div align=center><img width=450 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/47.png"/></div>

2. Double click the boot button to enter **boot mode**.

    <div align=center><img width=220 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/48.png"/></div>

    After this you will see a new storage drive shown on your file explorer as **GROVEAI** for **Grove - Vision AI Module**.

    > üíÅ The below image will be updated soon with the addition of **VISIONAI** drive.

    <div align=center><img width=280 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/19.jpg"/></div>

3. Drag and drop the below **.uf2 files** to **GROVEAI** drive according to your device.

    - [Grove - Vision AI](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_GroveAI/raw/master/tools/capture_images_Grove_AI_firmware.uf2)

    As soon as the uf2 finishes copying into the drive, the drive will disappear. This means the uf2 has been successfully uploaded to the module.

4. Copy and paste [this Python script](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_GroveAI/blob/master/tools/capture_images_script.py) inside a newly-created file named **capture_images_script.py** on your PC.

5. Execute the Python script to start capturing images.

    ```sh
    python3 capture_images_script.py
    ```

    By default, it will capture an image every 300ms. If you want to change this, you can run the script in this format

    ```sh
    python3 capture_images_script.py --interval <time_in_ms>
    ```

    For example, to capture an image every second 

    ```sh
    python3 capture_images_script.py --interval 1000
    ```

    After the above script is executed, Grove - Vision AI Module will start to capture images from the in-built cameras continuosly and save all of them inside a folder named **save_img**

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/41.png"/></div>

    Also, it will open a preview window while it is recording

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/40.jpg"/></div>

    After you have enough images captured, click on the terminal window and press the following key combinations to stop the capturing process

    - Windows: Ctrl + Break
    - Linux: Ctrl + Shift + \
    - Mac: CMD + Shift + \

### Task - Change device firmware after image collection

After you have finished recording images for the dataset, you need to make sure to change the firmware inside the Grove - Vision AI Module back to original, so that you can again load object detection models for detection. Let's go through the steps now.

1. Enter **Boot mode** on Grove - Vision AI Module as explained before.

2. Drag and drop the below **.uf2 files** to **GROVEAI** drive according to your device.
    - [Grove AI Vision](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_GroveAI/raw/master/tools/Grove_AI_default_firmware.uf2)

    As soon as the uf2 finishes copying into the drive, the drive will disappear. This means the uf2 has been successfully uploaded to the module.

### Task - Annotate dataset using Roboflow

If you use your own dataset, you will need to annotate all the images in your dataset. Annotating means simply drawing rectangular boxes around each object that we want to detect and assign them labels. We will explain how to do this using Roboflow.

[Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) is an annotation tool based online. Here we can directly import the video footage that we have recorded into Roboflow and it will be exported into a series of images. This tool is very convenient because it will let us help distribute the dataset into "training, validation and testing". Also this tool will allow us to add further processing to these images after labelling them. Furthermore, it can easily export the labelled dataset into **YOLOV5 PyTorch format** which is what we exactly need!

For this lesson, we will use a dataset with images containing apples so that we can detect apples later on and do counting as well.

1. Click [here](https://app.roboflow.com/login) to sign up for a Roboflow account.

2. Click **Create New Project** to start our project.

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV5/2.jpg"/></div>

3. Fill in **Project Name**, keep the **License (CC BY 4.0)** and **Project type (Object Detection (Bounding Box))**  as default. Under **What will your model predict?** column, fill in an annotation group name. For example, in our case we choose **apples**. This name should highlight all of the classes of your dataset. Finally, click **Create Public Project**.

    <div align=center><img width=350 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/6.jpg"/></div>

4. Drag and drop the images that you have captured using Grove - Vision AI Module.

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/7.png"/></div>

5. After the images are processed, click **Finish Uploading**. Wait patiently until the images are uploaded.

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/4.jpg"/></div>

6. After the images are uploaded, click **Assign Images**.

    <div align=center><img width=300 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/5.jpg"/></div>

7. Select an image, draw a rectangular box around an apple, choose the label as **apple** and press **ENTER**.

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/9.png"/></div>

8. Repeat the same for the remaining apples.

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/10.png"/></div>

    > üíÅ Try to label all the apples that you see inside the image. If only a part of an apple is visible, try to label that too.

9. Continue to annotate all the images in the dataset.

    Roboflow has a feature called **Label Assist** where it can predict the labels beforehand so that your labelling will be much faster. However, it will not work with all object types, but rather a selected type of objects. To turn this feature on, you simply need to press the **Label Assist** button, **select a model**, **select the classes** and navigate through the images to see the predicted labels with bounding boxes.

    <div align=center><img width=200 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV5/41.png"/></div>

    <div align=center><img width=400 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV5/39.png"/></div>

    <div align=center><img width=400 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV5/40.png"/></div>

    As you can see above, it can only help to predict annotations for the 80 classes mentioned. If your images do not contain the object classes from above, you cannot use the label assist feature.

10. Once labelling is done, click **Add images to Dataset**.

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV5/25.jpg"/></div>

11. Next we will split the images between "Train, Valid and Test". Keep the default percentages for the distribution and click **Add Images**.

    <div align=center><img width=330 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV5/26.png"/></div>

12. Click **Generate New Version**.

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV5/27.jpg"/></div>

13. Now you can add **Preprocessing** and **Augmentation** if you prefer. Here we will **change** the **Resize** option to **192x192**.

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/11.png"/></div>

    <div align=center><img width=450 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/13.png"/></div>

    Here we change the image size to 192x192 because we will use that size for training and the training will be faster. Otherwise, it will have to convert all images to 192x192 during the training process which consumes more CPU resources and makes the training process slower.

14. Next, proceed with the remaining defaults and click **Generate**

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/14.png"/></div>

15. Click **Export**, select **Format** as **YOLO v5 PyTorch**, select **show download code** and click **Continue**

<div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/54.png"/></div>

This will generate a code snippet that we will use later inside Google Colab training. So please keep this window open in the background.

<div align=center><img width=600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/55.png"/></div>

### Task - Train using YOLOv5 on Google Colab

After we are done with annotating the dataset, we need to train the dataset. Jump to [this part](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Train-Deploy-AI-Model/#train-using-yolov5-on-google-colab) which explains how to train an AI model using YOLOv5 running on Google Colab.

## <span id="jump3">Deploy the trained model and perform inference</span>

### Task - use model in Grove - Vision AI Module

Now we will move the **model-1.uf2** that we obtained at the end of the training into Grove - Vision AI Module. Here we will connect the Grove - Vision AI Module with the [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html) to view the inference results.

> üíÅ If this is your first time using Arduino, we highly recommend you to refer [Getting Started with Arduino](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Getting_Started_with_Arduino). Also, please follow [this wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Getting-Started/#getting-started) to setup Wio Terminal to work with Arduino IDE.

1. Install the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) or [Microsoft Edge browser](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?r=1) and open it.

2. Connect Grove - Vision AI Module into your PC via a USB Type-C cable.

    <div align=center><img width=450 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/47.png"/></div>

3. Double-click the boot button on Grove - Vision AI Module to enter mass storage mode.

    <div align=center><img width=220 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/48.png"/></div>

    After this you will see a new storage drive shown on your file explorer as **GROVEAI**.

    <div align=center><img width=280 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/19.jpg"/></div>

4. Drag and drop the **model-1.uf2** file to **GROVEAI** drive.

    As soon as the uf2 finishes copying into the drive, the drive will disappear. This means the uf2 has been successfully uploaded to the module.

    > üíÅ If you have 4 model files ready, you can drag and drop each model one-by-one. Drop first model, wait until it finishes copying, enter boot mode again, drop second model and so on.

5. While the Grove - Vision AI Module is still connected with the PC using USB, connect it to the Wio Terminal via the Grove I2C port as follows.

    <div align=center><img width=250 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/49.png"/></div>

6. Install [Seeed_Arduino_GroveAI library](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_GroveAI) into Arduino IDE and open **object_detection.ino** example.

7. If you have only loaded one model (with index 1) into Grove - Vision AI Module, it will load that model. However, if you have loaded multiple models, you can [specify which model to use](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_GroveAI/blob/master/examples/object_detection/object_detection.ino#L12) by changing **MODEL_EXT_INDEX_[value]** where value can take the digits 1,2,3 or 4.

    ```cpp
    // for example:
    if (ai.begin(ALGO_OBJECT_DETECTION, MODEL_EXT_INDEX_2))
    ```

    The above will load the model with index 2.

8. Since we are detecting apples, we will make a slight change to the code [here](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_GroveAI/blob/master/examples/object_detection/object_detection.ino#L55).

    ```cpp
    Serial.print("Number of apples: ");
    ```

9. Connect the Wio Terminal to PC, upload this code to the Wio Terminal and open serial monitor of Arduino IDE with 115200 as the baud rate.

    <div align=center><img width=500 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/42.png"/></div>

You will be able to see the detection information on the serial monitor as above.

10. [Click here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/grove_ai_vision/index.html) to open a preview window of the camera stream with the detections.

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/31.png"/></div>

11. Click **Connect** button. Then you will see a pop up on the browser. Select **Grove AI - Paired** and click **Connect**.

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/32.png"/></div>

12. View real-time inference results using the preview window!

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/33.jpg"/></div>

    As you can see above, the apples are being detected with bounding boxes around them. Here "0" corresponds to each detection of the same class. If you have multiple classes, they will be named as 0,1,2,3,4 and so on. Also the confidence score for each detected apple (0.8 and 0.84 in above demo) is being displayed!

If you feel more adventurous, you can continue to follow the rest of the wiki!

### Can I train an AI model on my PC?

You can also use your own PC to train an object detection model. However, the training preformance will depend on the hardware you have. You also need to have a PC with a Linux OS for training. We have used an Ubuntu 20.04 PC for this wiki.

1. Clone the **yolov5-swift repo** and install **requirements.txt** in a **Python>=3.7.0** environment.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/yolov5-swift 
    cd yolov5-swift
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. If you followed the steps in this wiki before, you might remember that we exported the dataset after annotating in Robolflow. Also in Roboflow Universe, we downloaded the dataset. In both methods, there was a window like below where it asks what kind of format to download the dataset. So now, please select **download zip to computer**, under **Format** choose **YOLO v5 PyTorch** and click **Continue**.

    <div align=center><img width=400 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/16.png"/></div>

    <div align=center><img width=400 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/17.png"/></div>

    After that, a **.zip file** will be downloaded to your computer

3. Copy and paste the .zip file that we downloaded into **yolov5-swift** directory and extract it.

    ```sh
    # example
    cp ~/Downloads/Apples.v1i.yolov5pytorch.zip ~/yolov5-swift
    unzip Apples.v1i.yolov5pytorch.zip
    ```

4. Open **data.yaml** file and edit **train** and **val** directories as follows.

    ```sh
    train: train/images
    val: valid/images
    ```

5. Download a pre-trained model suitable for our training.

    ```sh
    sudo apt install wget
    wget https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/yolov5-swift/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/yolov5n6-xiao.pt
    ```

6. Execute the following to start training.

    Here, we are able to pass a number of arguments:

    - **img:** define input image size
    - **batch:** determine batch size
    - **epochs:** define the number of training epochs
    - **data:** set the path to our yaml file
    - **cfg:** specify our model configuration
    - **weights:** specify a custom path to weights
    - **name:** result names
    - **nosave:** only save the final checkpoint
    - **cache:** cache images for faster training

    ```sh
    python3 train.py --img 192 --batch 64 --epochs 100 --data data.yaml --cfg yolov5n6-xiao.yaml --weights yolov5n6-xiao.pt --name yolov5n6_results --cache
    ```

    For an apple detection dataset with 987 images, it took around 30 minutes to finish the training process on a Local PC running on NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Super GPU with 6GB GPU memory.

    <div align=center><img width=1000 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP-A1101/44.png"/></div>

    If you followed the above Colab project, you know that you can load 4 models to the device all at once. However, please not that only one model can be loaded at a time. This can be specified by the user and will be explained later in this wiki.

7. If you navigate to `runs/train/exp/weights`, you will see a file called **best.pt**. This is the generated model from training.

    <div align=center><img width=600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV5/33.jpg"/></div>

8. Export the trained model to TensorFlow Lite.

    ```sh
    python3 export.py --data {dataset.location}/data.yaml --weights runs/train/yolov5n6_results/weights/best.pt --imgsz 192 --int8 --include tflite  
    ```

9. Convert TensorFlow Lite to a UF2 file.

    UF2 is a file format, developed by Microsoft. Seeed uses this format to convert .tflite to .uf2, allowing tflite files to be stored on the AIoT devices launched by Seeed. Currently Seeed's devices support up to 4 models, each model (.tflite) is less than 1M.

    You can specify the model to be placed in the corresponding index with -t.

    For example:

    - `-t 1`: index 1 
    - `-t 2`: index 2 

    ```sh
    # Place the model to index 1
    python3 uf2conv.py -f GROVEAI -t 1 -c runs//train/yolov5n6_results//weights/best-int8.tflite -o model-1.uf2
    ```

    Eventhough you can load 4 models to the device all at once, please not that only one model can be loaded at a time. This can be specified by the user and will be explained later in this wiki.

10. Now a file named **model-1.uf2** will be generated. This is the file that we will load into the Grove - Vision AI Module to perform the inference!
