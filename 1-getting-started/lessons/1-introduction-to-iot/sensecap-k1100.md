## Setup

SenseCraft is an open source software platform to build smart sensors with no-code. It is a program built into the Wio Terminal in SenseCAP K1100.

Before you begin, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of SenseCraft to ensure the most stable experience.

### Task - setup

Install the required SenseCraft and update the firmware.

1. You can download and update the latest version in our **SenseCraft distribution** by clicking on the URL below.

    >üîó: https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/SenseCraft/releases

    After downloading SenseCraft to your local disk, please follow the instructions below to flash it into Wio Terminal.

1. Connect the Wio Terminal to PC and turn in ON, Enter **Bootloader Mode** by sliding down the power switch further away from "ON" position, release, slide again and release.

    > üíÅ Once Wio Terminal is in the Bootloader mode, the blue LED will start to breathe in a way that is different from blinking.

## Navigate the UI using buttons

Before you get into learning the operating interface, you need to get used to the Button logic we have designed for Wio Terminal. In this way, you will be able to select and operate pages very smoothly according to the fixed Button logic.

### Task - master SenseCraft button logic

1. First are the three buttons located above the Wio Terminal. They correspond to the display screens of the three main functions. They are **Sense**, **Process** and **Uplink** respectively.

![SenseCraft Three button](../../../images/sensecraft-button-logic.png)

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;No matter where you are, when you press the three buttons at the top, you will be able to go back to these three screens.

1. Then there is the five-way directional button located at the bottom right of Wio Terminal, which allows you to perform the following operations:

![SenseCraft Fove button](../../../images/sensecraft-button.png)

- **Left/ Right:** Scroll through pages/ menus left and right
- **Middle:** Make a selection
- **Up:** Go back to the previous page

3. When a green box appears on the page, it indicates that the content is in the selected state.

![SenseCraft green box](../../../images/sensecraft-green-box.png)

## Page Logic

As mentioned above, we have prepared three pages for SenseCraft, representing the three main functional modules of SenseCraft, namely **Sense**, **Process** and **Uplink**.

### Task - learn the functions of Sense page

1. The main function of the Sense page is the sensor data display. Of course, if you try to connect the Grove sensors in the kit to the Grove connector on the **right** side of the Wio Terminal, you will find that the Wio Terminal will automatically detect the type of sensors and read their values.

2. Wio Terminal has three built-in sensors: a light sensor, a sound loudness sensor, and a three-axis sensor. After you power Wio Terminal up, wait a few seconds and you will be able to see the values of the built-in sensors directly on the Sense page.

![Sense Page](../../../images/sense-page.png)

3. 



### Task - learn the functions of Process page

![Process Page](../../../images/process-page.png)

1. The main function of the **Process** page is to show the process of data processing. We have currently developed log output for this page for the recognition and model processing of the Grove Vision AI module.

    In the future, we will give Wio Terminal more powerful data filtering and processing capabilities for this page.

### Task - learn the functions of Uplink page

![Uplink Page](../../../images/uplink-page.png)

1. The main function of the **Uplink** page is to upload data to the cloud. Users can configure which IoT method you want to use, LoRa¬Æ or WiFi, on this page.

    Here, you can freely configure your exclusive IoT features, freely switch between different networks and platforms, and create its value for this set of devices.

## Connect the other Grove sensors in the kit

In addition to the built-in sensors, the possibilities of SenseCraft are endless. The Grove sensor in the kit is also allowed to access the Wio Terminal and is automatically recognised.

### Plug a Grove sensor into Wio Terminal

In the current version of SenseCraft we only support the simultaneous connection of one sensor for use. (except for the Grove Wio E5)

When connecting, you can use the Grove cable provided in the kit to connect one of the sensors you want to use to the Grove connector on the bottom right of the Wio Terminal.

<div align=center><img width=800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/K1100-quick-start/55.png"/></div>

The diagram above shows the Grove Vision AI as an example, indicating how the sensors in the kit are connected. Of course, the same applies to other sensors. (except for the Grove Wio E5)

!!!Attention
	Do not connect the Grove sensor in the kit to the Grove connector on the left side of the Wio Terminal. The Grove connector on the left is currently designed for the connection of the Grove Wio E5.

### View Grove sensor values

Once you have connected the Grove sensor you will be able to view the Grove sensor values in the Sense page.

You just need to press the **right** arrow button under the **Sense** page until the value of the external sensor appears. Usually, the value of the external sensor will be after the **IMU sensor**.

<div align=center><img width=800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/K1100-quick-start/56.png"/></div>

### Uploading data from Grove sensors to the cloud

The detection of the sensor by SenseCraft is fully automatic, so we don't need the user to do anything extra. Of course, this all includes the uploading of data after the newly inserted Grove sensor.

- Similarly, if you want to send data from your Grove sensors over LoRaWAN¬Æ, you just need to **connect your Grove Wio E5 on the left side** at the same time.

<div align=center><img width=800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/K1100-quick-start/57.png"/></div>

Then, follow the steps in **[Send sensor data to SenseCAP via LoRa¬Æ](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/K1100-quickstart/#send-sensor-data-to-sensecap-via-lora)**.

- If you want to send data out via WiFi, then you do not need to connect anything else, please continue to refer to the contents of **[Send sensor data to Ubidots via WiFi](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/K1100-quickstart/#send-sensor-data-to-ubidots-via-wifi)** for action.

<div align=center><img width=800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/K1100-quick-start/58.png"/></div>

## Advanced Play

We have designed a number of very interesting and advanced ways to play with SenseCraft, and you can get a quick overview and use these features with this section.

### Vision AI real-time analysis

This is a feature designed for Grove Vision AI. Users can observe the running log of Vision AI under this interface, which is convenient for users to observe the recognition of Vision AI in real time, adjust the camera screen, etc.

**Step 1.** Connect the Grove Vision AI

Please connect your Grove Vision AI to the Grove connector on the **right** side of the Wio Terminal.

<div align=center><img width=800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/K1100-quick-start/55.png"/></div>

**Step 2.** Access the Vision AI real-time analysis interface

Please click on the second button above the Wio Terminal to access the **Process** screen.

The default selection under the Process screen is **Vision AI real-time analysis**, at which point we simply **middle press** on the 5-way button to enter.

<div align=center><img width=800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/K1100-quick-start/59.png"/></div>

<div align=center><img width=800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/K1100-quick-start/62.png"/></div>

### Graph Visualization

We have provided the Wio Terminal with a line graph display so that you can observe how the data changes in the values of each sensor.

Take the example of a line graph of light values.

Since the Light column is already highlighted, **middle press** on the 5-way button to enter graph visualization mode for the data from the light sensor.

<div align=center><img width=800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/K1100-quick-start/63.png"/></div>

### Save to TF Card

Considering that users may have the need to save offline to an TF card and only require subsequent data filtering or analysis, we have also designed the Wio Terminal with the ability to save data to a TF card.

When in graph visualization mode as described before, **middle press** again to view this page.

<div align=center><img width=800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/K1100-quick-start/65.png"/></div>

This is where the data from the sensor can be saved to an TF card. First insert an TF card to the Wio Terminal.

After that, press the **middle button** to select **Save to TF card** and it will show the message **Saving has been started**. Once this message dissappears, the saving is finished and it will save the data as a **.csv file**.

<div align=center><img width=800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/K1100-quick-start/64.png"/></div>

If the storage on the TF card is full, it will notify as follows.

<div align=center><img width=800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/K1100-quick-start/66.png"/></div>
